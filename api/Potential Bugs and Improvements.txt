Potential bugs:
1. The values I put into the program for tolerances and multipliers are relatively specific so I'm not sure how well they'll stand up against a variety of situations.

2. When text sticks out of the highlight, I basically increase the size of the block by a multiplier, which won't work if the highlight is too short or the text is too tall compared to the highlighted zone.

3. Probably won't work when the paper is darker than the highlight because of my code detecting text sticking out of highlighted zones.

4. Google Vision might interpret a word as being two separate words if there's enough spacing between the letters, which means the definition of the word won't be looked up because I made the function dealing with Google Vision ignore when two words are highlighted.

5. Maybe not a bug, but it won't work when a highlight has more than one word.

6. Also maybe not a bug, but it won't detect text sticking out of the highlight if the text is a lighter color than the highlight color.


Potential improvements:
1. Because I now have the block of code that recursively finds individual highlighted words, the block of code that filters out text and the block of code that finds top left and bottom right bounds of each color might be able to be replaced just with that one block of code with the recursion as long as it's slightly modified to do its thing across the entire image.

2. The block of code adjusting coordinates to account for text sticking out of the highlight can be improved with recursion similar to the recursion I did to find individual highlight blocks. It would have to recursively find the top left and bottom right coordinates of the text sticking out and adjust the coordinates of the block if needed.

3. In the block of code detecting if text is sticking out of the coordinate block, the function I use to detect it can be improved. Right now it just loosely compares how much darker the text sticking out is compared to the highlighted zone based on basic addition and a loose tolerance. There's probably a better way to tell how much darker one color is than another out there.
